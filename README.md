## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - JS library


### What I learned

I used this project to refresh my knowledge of REST APIs fetching and GET action, with the help of [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) I build a simple random advice generator.
For styling I learned how to position an element at the center of another element's border, the dice button to get a new random advice.

### Continued development

In the next projects I want to focus on handling both state and data retrieved from an API call, also I want to focus on
the other REST methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).


### Useful resources

- [How can I center an absolutely positioned element in a div](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1776915/how-can-i-center-an-absolutely-positioned-element-in-a-div) - Lionel Paulus response. This helped me to align horizontally the dice button with responsive design in mind. Before this fix, the icon would misalign horizontally.
